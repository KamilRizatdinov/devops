# Terraform best practices

* Do not expose your credentials
* Avoid hard coding the resources
* Isolate environment
* Turn on debug when you need do troubleshooting
* Enable version control on terraform state files bucket
* Verify your terraform files, TF team does a lot of effort for this to work properly
* Split your terraform configuration files to different "building blocks" for better readability
