## Describe and explain in the report the differences between the output of the command for replicas

Commands output differences because we use StatefulSet instead of Deployment kind. This means that we will have different persistent volume claim (PVC) for each of the pods, instead of just 1 PVC for all of them when using Deployment kind.

## For our app ordering guarantee are unnecessary. Describe in the report why

Where is no pods communication and dependency in our application.
We don't have master-slave architecture where we need a guarantee that master will be launched first.
We don't have pod-to-pod communication, where is no need to guarantee that recipient should be up in order to serve request from the sender.

## Then find a way to tell to the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel

The way to do that is to set podManagementPolicy to "Parallel", this way our pods will be launched, updated and terminated in parallel.
